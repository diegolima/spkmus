spkmus
======

This script makes it easy to write songs to be played using any computer's
good ol' speaker. It reads notes and their duration in plain written language
and calculates their proper frequency and duration for a given BPM (beats per
minute).

It also features a rough-but-functional client-server model, using perl scripts
that start the main script. This implementation should be considered only a
proof-of-concept that allows multiple computers to play different scores in a 
synchronized way.

Please note that currently only note names written in portuguese are supported.



Requirements
=============

- beep: the "beep" command should be available and in your $PATH. On debian
systems this can be installed by issuing the "apt-get install beep" command.

- Working PC Speaker: This is rather obvious, but nowadays some systems 
(particularly notebooks) are shipped without a true pc speaker. Also many
distros do not load the "pcspkr" module. If you find you have no sound, you
may try this command:

modprobe pcspkr





How to Use
==========

Scores are currently written in the main spkmus script, and there are a couple
of functional examples inside. You should run the script after uncommenting the
appropriate song name on the beggining of the script.

After that you should run the script with the following command:

./spkmus.sh
